#Special Features/Considerations:

The form includes a date picker and time picker to make it easy for customers to select the date and time of their reservation.
The "Number of Guests" field is a dropdown menu that limits the number of guests to a maximum of 10. This is to ensure that the restaurant can accommodate all guests and maintain a high level of service.
The "Notes" field is optional, but it allows customers to communicate any additional needs or preferences they have for their reservation. This can help the restaurant provide a better dining experience for their customers.
